# Realistic-Rain-Effect-in-Adobe-Photoshop

Design

To create a realistic rain effect is super easy to make. First add a new layer. Then, change its color to White. I used Paint Bucket Tool to convert it into White. Then, go to filter panel, Pixalate and apply Mizzotint effect on it. Choose Fine Dots in the Mizzotint Panel. This will add white dots on the layer.

Then, super zoom into the picture upto 500% and go to select panel , and choose color range. Here, choose the white dots created by Mizzotint Effect, this will select those dots. Convert the selection to layer mask, then double click on the mask panel to go to layer and mask panel and change the value of feather and contrast to control the value of these dots. More dots means more heavy is the rain. 

Then simply apply path blur from blur gallary in filter panel to change the direction of dots and give them a rainy look. To make the rain more heavy, that layer can also be duplicated accordingly.

To make the effect more realistic, I added a brightness/contrast effect on top of the picture and decreased the brightness of picture to make a more realistic cloudy effect. Then, I converted it to clipping mask so that it only affects the picture below. Here, is our Realistic Rain Effect in Adobe Photoshop.
